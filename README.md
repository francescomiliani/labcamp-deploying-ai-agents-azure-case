## Fine Tuning

In the `fine tuning dataset` folder, you can find pre-created dataset files that you can use for fine-tuning related to an exercise: `Festival di Sanremo 2024`.

Using these files, you can directly proceed with the fine-tuning process via the `Azure AI Agent Service`.

## Create and use an AI Agent

TBD

During the labcamp, we will provide you with an `.env` file, containing secret api keys. This file should be uploaded in the Files section in a Colab notebook (or stored in the root directory of the local project). refer to `.env.template` for an example of how to store the keys.
